This is a simple HTTP response server implemented in C. I did this to learn more about HTTP requests and how sockets work. This is NOT a full fledge HTTP server like Apache,Nginx etc. When you launch the server and send it an HTTP request from your browser, it sends you back an HTML page. You can create your own HTML page and change the code so that it sends that HTML page instead of home.html.
